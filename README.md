The repository contains nine folders ppl_q1 to ppl_q8 and a documentation folder which contains documentation for ppl_q3-ppl_q8.Documentations of ppl_q1 and ppl_q2 are in their respective folders. Each of the folders except "Documentation: contains the Source Codes, Class Diagram and the output files. The codes are written in cpp.

# GETTING STARTED

Project was made and tested in Ubuntu 16.10.
C++11 Complier or above required.
The Project was built using: Sublime Text 3.
The Documentation was made using Doxygen and Latex.
The class Diagrams were made using StarUML and Visual Paradigm.

# PREREQUISITES

g++ Compiler.
BUILDING AND RUNNING

# VALUES

Number of boys,girls and gifts taken are 80,60 and 100 respectively.
Nothing is inputted from the console.
The value of K (if required) is taken through rand() function.


# QUESTION 1

Open the Folder ppl_q1
Build the code using the following command (random input utility is included in the library itself):

g++ q1.cpp input.cpp The_Generous_Boy.cpp The_Choosy_Girl.cpp

And then give the command:

./a.out

This will print the relationships in the console and a output_1.txt file will be generated.

# QUESTION 2

Open the Folder ppl_q2
Build the code using the following command (random input utility is included in the library itself):

g++ q2.cpp input_gifts.cpp The_Utility_Gifts.cpp The_Choosy_Girl.cpp The_Generous_Boy.cpp couple.cpp

And then give the command:

./a.out

then give the value of k in terminal.
This will print the gift exchanges , k happiest couples, k most compatible couples in the console and output will be printed in output_2.txt file


# QUESTION 3

1. Open the Folder ppl_q3
2. Open terminal and change the address to this folder directory.
3. enter this command to build the code:
          g++ q3.cpp input_gifts.cpp The_Utility_Gifts.cpp The_Choosy_Girl.cpp The_Generous_Boy.cpp couple.cpp
4. then hit the command ./a.out
5. This will print the gifting between all the couples and the 'k' most happiest and compatible couples along with their happiness and compatibility values on console and the same result will also be stored in ouput_3.txt file.Value of k was generated randomly.


# QUESTION 4

Open the Folder ppl_q4
Open terminal and change the address to ppl_q4 folder directory.
Build the code using the following command:
          g++ q2.cpp input_gifts.cpp The_Utility_Gifts.cpp The_Choosy_Girl.cpp The_Generous_Boy.cpp couple.cpp
 Then enter the command ./a.out.This will print the randomly generated value of "k" and the k least happy couples on console
 
 Again Build the code using the following command:
          g++ q4_input.cpp The_Choosy_Girl.cpp The_Generous_Boy.cpp q4.cpp
  now again enter the command ./a.out. This will print the new pairs who brokeup and the same will also be printed in ## q4_output.txt
